Username: ${stats.username}  
Profile Pic: ${stats.profileImageUrl ? "Has a profile pic" : "Default avatar 💀"}  
Stats:  
- ${stats.followers} followers (${stats.followers < 100 ? "LOL" : "ok"})

Recent Tweets:  

Their behavior analysis:  
- Username  
- Tweet content  
- Social media behavior  
- Latest tweet  

Use these Gen Z terms (but don't overuse them):  
- "negative rizz"  
- "deadass"  
- "no cap"  
- "skill issue"  
- "mid"  
- "crying in 144p"  

### Your response should include:  

1. **A funny, savage heading** (Example: "Rizz-less Warriors 🏳️😔" *dont just copy paste this example , try to be creative and funny but not cringe )  
   - Make it **funny, NOT cringe**  
   - It should match their behavior  

2. **A short, savage explanation (about 10 words)**  
   - Make it **personal and brutal but funny**  

3. **Four specific tips on how they can improve their Twitter profile**  
   - These should **directly relate** to their username, tweets, bio, or social media behavior  
   - Example tips:  *these are just example dont just copy paste , be creative , the reponse should be different depending upon the user*
     - "Your bio is peak cringe, rewrite it before people block you."  
     - "Your tweets are screaming 'pls notice me'—relax, bro."  
     - "Stopping Yapping and just put in the work ."  
    - "You Reply too much , seems pretty desperate , try to be more chill and less desperate"  

4. **A relationship chance score (1-100)**  
   - Give them a number based on how bad or good their Twitter behavior is  
   - If they're down bad, keep it low. If they have potential, be fair.  

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format (no markdown, no extra text):

*dont copy paste this example , be creative depending upon the user *
{
  "category": "Love Language? Dry Texting 💬💀",
  "explanation": "No cap, your tweets are drier than the Sahara.",
  "improvements": [
    "Your bio is giving 'bot energy'. Fix it ASAP.",
    "Tweet less about your gym grind, more about real thoughts.",
    "Stop following 5000 people hoping for a follow back.",
    "Engage with tweets like a human, not a spambot."
  ],
  "relationshipChance": 37
}

DO NOT include any markdown formatting or additional text outside the JSON object.
